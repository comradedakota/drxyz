It's always felt awkward to write about myself in the third person, so I'll keep this as informal as possible. My name is Dakota. No "About" page on a blog is ever going to truly capture the essence of who I am, let alone the full-story... So, for now I'll just tell you that I am:

- constantly questioning my understanding of the world around me.
- routinely fucking with any/all sorts of technology that I can get my hands on.
- enamored with emersive games and great storytelling.

If you ask about my politics, I'm inclined to answer by directing your attention to the bullet points above and state that I believe in the posibility of a world that is equitable for all, but I also know it will require the kind of collective ego-death that only tends to occur amidst radical, cultural revolutions...

And since everyone seems to have their own idea of what revolution looks like, I'm simply starting with the things that I can do and not getting hung up on the details. Anything more than that, you'll just have to [read about](../posts/) or [ask me](../contact/).

Regards,
Dakota
