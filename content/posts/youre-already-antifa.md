For anyone who hasn't already reviewed today's piece on JustSecurity entitled "[How Designating Antifa as a Foreign Terrorist Organization Could Threaten Civil Liberties](https://www.justsecurity.org/122643/antifa-threaten-civil-liberties/)", I highly recommend you do so before reading this post... Because, the unfortunate news is, whether you chose it or not... 

You're already - or soon to be - connected to a terrorist organization... Because everyone they don't like is Antifa... Get the picture now, y'all?

You're already an enemy of the state... The smartest thing to do now is at least act like you're good at it.

Lock down your comms, participate in LITERALLY ANY kind of weekly check-in with your folx, prep your bug-out bag(s), contribute to local mutual aid/direct action, and for the love of god...

Unlearn your current political tools... OUR STRENGTH IS IN OUR LABOR AND OUR NUMBERS!
